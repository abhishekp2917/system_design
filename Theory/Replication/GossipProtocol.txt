*   What is Gossip Protocol ?

>>  The Gossip Protocol is a decentralized communication mechanism inspired by how rumors or information spreads in 
    social networks. 
    
    Each node in a distributed system periodically shares information with a subset of other nodes. 
    
    Over time, this ensures that all nodes in the system have a consistent view of the system's state.

    How Gossip Protocol Works:

        (1) Initialization:

            - Each node starts with its local state and a list of peers it knows about.

        (2) Periodic Gossiping:

            - At regular intervals, each node randomly selects one or more peers and shares information 
            (e.g., node state, updates) with them.

        (3) Information Merging:

            - Upon receiving information, a node merges it with its own state, resolving conflicts 
            using specific rules (e.g., timestamps, vector clocks etc).

        (4) Propagation:

            - Over multiple rounds, information spreads exponentially, reaching all nodes in the network.

        (5) Convergence:

            - Eventually, all nodes in the system have a consistent view of the state.

    Advantages:

        (1) Scalability:

            - Works efficiently in systems with thousands or millions of nodes.

        (2) Resilience:

            - Can tolerate node failures and network partitions.

        (3) Load Distribution:

            - Each node handles a small amount of communication, avoiding bottlenecks.

        (4) Self-Healing:

            - The system can recover from inconsistencies automatically over time.

        (5) Simple Implementation:

            - Easy to design and deploy without the need for centralized control.

    Disadvantages:
        
        (1) Latency:

            - Information propagation is not instantaneous; it may take several rounds to reach all nodes.

        (2) Redundant Messages:

            - Can generate duplicate messages, increasing bandwidth usage.

        (3) Conflict Resolution Complexity:

            - Handling conflicts (e.g., which update is correct) can be challenging in some scenarios.

        (4) Inefficiency for Small Networks:

            - In small clusters, gossip protocols might be less efficient than centralized approaches.

    Where is Gossip Protocol Used?
        
        (1) Distributed Databases:

            - E.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB: Used for propagating metadata and ensuring consistency among nodes.

        (2) Cluster Membership:

            - E.g., Consul, Serf: Used to track which nodes are alive or dead in a cluster.

        (3) Monitoring Systems:

            - E.g., Prometheus Federation: For sharing health and state information across nodes.
