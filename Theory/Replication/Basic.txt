*   What are various types of Replication ?

>>  (1) Synchronous Replication:
        
        Data is written to all the replicas simultaneously before sending acknowledgment to the client, ensuring all 
        nodes have consistent data at any point.
        
        Advantages:
            
            - Strong consistency.
        
        Disadvantages:
            
            - Slower write performance due to the need for acknowledgments from all replicas.

    (2) Asynchronous Replication:

        Data is written to the primary node and it sends the acknowledgment to the client. The data propagates to replicas
        later.

        Advantages:
        
            - Faster write operations.
        
        Disadvantages:
            
            - Data may be temporarily inconsistent across replicas.
            - Risk of data loss if the primary fails before replication completes.
