*   What is a CDN (Content Delivery Network) ?

>>  A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of servers designed to deliver web content, such 
    as images, videos, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, more efficiently and quickly to users.

    There are called Edge Servers or Points of Presence because geographically they are located closer to the end user which 
    reduces network latency. 

    Key Features of a CDN:
        
        Content Caching:

            - Stores copies of static assets like images, stylesheets, and scripts at multiple locations.
            - Reduces load on the origin server.

        Geographical Distribution:

            - CDNs are located worldwide to serve users in their regions.
            - Minimizes latency by reducing the physical distance between users and servers (CDNs).
            
        Dynamic and Static Content Delivery:

            - Primarily serves static content like images or videos.
            - Some advanced CDNs can handle dynamic content delivery using caching or real-time optimization.

    How Does a CDN Work:
        
        (1) User Request:
            
            - A user makes a request (e.g., loading a webpage or streaming a video).

        (2) Nearest Edge Server:
            
            - The CDN routes the request to the nearest edge server based on the userâ€™s geographical location.

        (3) Cache Check:
            
            - The edge server checks if it has the requested content cached.

        (4) Cache Hit: 
        
            - Content is served directly.
        
        (5) Cache Miss: 
        
            - The edge server retrieves the content from the origin server and caches it for future requests.

        (6) Content Delivery:
            
            - The edge server delivers the requested content to the user.

    Benefits:
        
        (1) Improved Performance:

            - Faster load times by reducing latency through geographically distributed servers.
        
        (2) Scalability:

            - Handles large spikes in traffic without overwhelming the origin server.
        
        (3) Reliability:

            - Redundant servers ensure that content is available even if one server goes offline.

        (4) Cost Efficiency:

            - Reduces bandwidth costs by offloading traffic from the origin server.
