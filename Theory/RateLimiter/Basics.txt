*   What is Rate Limiter ?

>>  A rate limiter is used to control the rate at which requests are processed, ensuring that a system is not overwhelmed 
    by excessive requests. 
    
    Rate limiting reduces the possibility of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks by placing restrictions on the maximum number 
    of requests that can be served in a given amount of time.

*   What are various types of Rate Limiting ?

>>  (1) IP-based Rate Limiting:

        - The number of requests that can be sent from a single IP address in a specified amount of time is limited by 
          IP-based rate limitation (e.g., 10 requests per minute). 
          
        - Restricting the amount of traffic from a single IP address is frequently used to stop abuses like bots and 
          Denial-of-Service attacks.

        Advantages:
            
            - It’s simple to implement at both the network and application level.
            
            - If someone is trying to flood the system with requests, limiting their IP can prevent this.
        
        Disadvantages:
            
            - Attackers can use techniques like VPNs, proxy servers, or even botnets to spoof different IPs and get 
              around the limit.
            
            - If multiple users share the same IP address (like in a corporate network), a legitimate user could get 
              blocked if someone else on the same network exceeds the limit.

    (2) Server-based Rate Limiting:

        - The number of requests that can be sent to a particular server in a predetermined period of time 
          (e.g., 100 requests per second) is controlled by server-based rate restriction.

        Advantages:
            
            - Helps protect the server from being overwhelmed, especially during peak usage.
        
        Disadvantages:
            
            - Attackers can spread their requests across multiple servers, staying within the rate limit for each server 
              while still overwhelming the system overall..
            
            - If the limit is too low or the server is under heavy load, even legitimate users might face delays or blocks.


    (3) Geography-based Rate Limiting:

        - Geography-based rate limiting restricts traffic based on the geographic location of the IP address. 
        
        - It’s useful for blocking malicious requests that originate from certain regions (for example, countries known 
          for high levels of cyber attacks), or for complying with regional laws and regulations.

        Advantages:

            - If you know certain regions are the source of a lot of bad traffic (e.g., spam, hacking attempts), you can 
              limit requests from those areas.
            
            - Helps comply with local data protection laws or restrictions on content in certain countries.
        
        Disadvantages:
            
            - Attackers can use VPNs or proxy servers to disguise their actual location and get around geography-based limits.
            
            - Users traveling or accessing services via international servers (like employees using VPNs) might get 
              blocked if they’re in a region that's restricted.
