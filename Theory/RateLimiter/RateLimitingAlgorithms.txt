*   Explain Token Bucket rate limiting algorithm in detail ?

>>  How It Works:

        (1) Tokens in a Bucket:

            - A bucket holds tokens which represents permission to process one request.
           
            - The bucket has a fixed capacity (e.g., 100 tokens).

        (2) Adding Tokens:

            - Tokens are added to the bucket at a constant rate (e.g., 10 tokens per second).
            
            - If the bucket is full, new tokens are discarded until space is available.
        
        (3) Processing Requests:

            - When a request arrives, the algorithm checks if there’s at least one token in the bucket.
            
            - If a token is available, it is removed, and the request is processed.
            
            - If no tokens are available, the request is denied or delayed.

        (4) Handling Bursts:

            - If the bucket has accumulated tokens (because of lower traffic earlier), it can allow a burst of requests 
              up to the bucket’s capacity.

            - Once tokens are depleted, the algorithm throttles further requests to the token replenishment rate.

    Example:

        - Bucket Capacity   : 10 tokens
        
        - Token Refill Rate : 2 tokens/second

        - At time T0, the bucket is full with 10 tokens.
        
        - At T1 (1 second later), 2 tokens are added, reaching the maximum of 10 tokens (if none were used).
        
        - If a burst of 7 requests arrives, all are processed, leaving 3 tokens.
        
        - If another burst of 5 requests arrives immediately after, only 3 are processed, and the remaining 2 are denied.
    
    Advantages:

        (1) Burst Handling:

            - Supports short bursts of traffic, as tokens accumulate during idle periods.
            
            - Provides flexibility for scenarios with variable traffic patterns.
        
        (2) Simplicity:

            - Easy to understand and implement.
            
            - Works efficiently in distributed systems.

        (3) Efficient Resource Usage:

            - Prevents overloading the system by throttling requests when necessary.

        (4) Fine Control:

            - Allows independent control of burst size (bucket capacity) and steady traffic rate (token refill rate).

    Disadvantages:

        (1) Overhead:

            - Requires maintaining state for each bucket (e.g., tokens and last refill time) which can be memory-intensive 
              in large-scale systems.

        (2) Limited Precision:

            - It may not prevent large bursts over longer timeframes if multiple buckets accumulate tokens.

        (3) Fairness:

            - If multiple clients share a bucket, it does not guarantee fairness, as a single client could deplete tokens 
              rapidly.
