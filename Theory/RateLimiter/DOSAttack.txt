*   What is DoS (Denial-of-Service) Attack ?

>>  A DoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a target system, network, or service by 
    overwhelming it with an excessive amount of requests. 
    
    The primary goal of a DoS attack is to make the target unavailable to legitimate users.

    How DoS Attack Works:

        (1) Flooding with Excessive Requests:

            - The attacker sends an overwhelming number of requests to the target, exhausting its resources 
              (e.g., CPU, memory, bandwidth).

        (2) Resource Exhaustion:

            - The server becomes unable to process legitimate requests due to limited resources like processing power, 
              memory, or bandwidth being fully utilized.

        (3) Service Unavailability:

            - Legitimate users experience significant delays, errors, or complete inability to access the service.

*   What is DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) Attack ?

>>  A DDoS attack is an enhanced version of a DoS attack, where multiple sources work together to overwhelm a target system. 
    
    The goal is to disrupt the targetâ€™s normal operation, making it inaccessible to legitimate users.

    How DDoS Attack Works:

        (1) Botnet Creation:

            - Attackers infect a large number of devices (IoT devices, computers, smartphones, etc.) with malware to 
              create a botnet (a network of devices hijacked by attacker).
            
            - These devices are controlled remotely by attacker without the knowledge of their owners.

        (2) Attack Execution:

            - The attacker instructs all the devices in the botnet to send massive amounts of traffic to the target.
        
        (3) Target Overload:

            - The flood of incoming traffic consumes the target's bandwidth, CPU, memory, or other resources, causing 
              it to slow down, crash, or become completely unavailable.
    
    Why Are DDoS Attacks So Effective:

        (1) Distributed Sources:

            - Traffic comes from thousands (or millions) of devices, making it hard to distinguish legitimate requests 
              from malicious ones.
        
        (2) Global Scale:

            - Botnets are often distributed worldwide, making it difficult to block traffic based on geographic location.

        (3) Dynamic Nature:

            - Attackers can adjust their tactics, such as changing the type of traffic or attack vector, to evade detection.
