*   What is CAP Theorem ?

>>  (1) Consistency (C)
        
        Consistency ensures that all nodes in the distributed system have the same data at any given time.
        
        If a banking system updates a user's account balance, any query to the system reflects the updated balance, no 
        matter which node the query is routed to.

    (2) Availability (A)

        Availability ensures that every request receives a response, even if some nodes in a cluster are unreachable.

        A social media application allows user to update it's profile at any givn point of time.

    (3) Partition Tolerance (P)

        Partition tolerance means the system continues to operate (e.g., serving reads, monitoring etc) despite network 
        partitions, where some nodes/replicas in a cluster cannot communicate with others.

        A network partition occurs when a failure (e.g., network outage) prevents nodes from synchronizing with each other.


    CAP theorem states that a distributed system during network partitions can either be Consistent or Available but can't
    be both at the same time. 

    In real world, since network partition in a distributed system is inevitable, Partition Tolerance (P) is usually 
    considered a necessity.
        
    Engineers often face a tradeoff between Consistency (C) and Availability (A).

    For example:

        - In financial systems, Consistency is critical (e.g., account balance accuracy).
        - In social media systems, Availability is prioritized to ensure users can post and see updates, even if some 
          data is temporarily inconsistent.
